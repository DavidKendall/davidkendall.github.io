# Projects

I am available to supervise both BSc and MSc projects. I
am happy to discuss any project ideas in the areas of my current, or
previous, courses.  Preferably, I will supervise students who wish to
choose one of the projects from my list
of <a href="projects.html">BSc and MSc Projects</a>.


# Computer Science and Engineering

I am a member of the Department of Computer Science in the Faculty of
Engineering and Environment and most of my
teaching is concerned with Computer Science and Computer Engineering. 
The ACM provide [curricula recommendations](https://www.acm.org/education/curricula-recommendations) in these areas.
